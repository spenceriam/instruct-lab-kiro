# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Instruct-Lab is an AI system instruction testing and optimization platform that enables developers to evaluate their system instructions across multiple AI models using OpenRouter's unified API. The platform provides quantitative metrics on instruction effectiveness through a dual-model evaluation approach, helping developers optimize their AI interactions scientifically rather than through trial and error.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test my AI system instructions across different models, so that I can optimize their effectiveness with quantitative data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application THEN I SHALL see a clean landing page with hero section and start testing button
2. WHEN I click "Start Testing" THEN I SHALL see a modal with a 4-step wizard (Setup, Instructions, Test, Results)
3. WHEN I enter an OpenRouter API key THEN the system SHALL validate it and enable model selection
4. WHEN I search for models with 2+ characters THEN the system SHALL query OpenRouter API and display matching models
5. WHEN I select a model THEN the system SHALL enable progression to the instructions step

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input my system instructions and test prompts, so that I can evaluate how well they work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm on the instructions step THEN I SHALL see a large textarea for system instructions input
2. WHEN I type in the textarea THEN the system SHALL show a character count
3. WHEN I proceed to the test step THEN I SHALL see my selected model displayed
4. WHEN I enter a test prompt THEN the system SHALL enable the "Run Evaluation" button
5. WHEN I click "Run Evaluation" THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with spinner

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see quantitative success metrics for my instructions, so that I can understand their effectiveness objectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL display an overall success probability score (0-100%)
2. WHEN results are shown THEN I SHALL see four detailed metrics: Coherence, Task Completion, Instruction Adherence, and Efficiency
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN I SHALL see token usage, execution time, and cost estimates
4. WHEN results load THEN the system SHALL animate from 0 to final values for visual impact
5. WHEN evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message with retry button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track my testing history across sessions, so that I can compare different instruction variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a test THEN the system SHALL save results to browser session storage
2. WHEN I return to the main page THEN I SHALL see a history table with all previous test results
3. WHEN viewing history THEN I SHALL see columns for model, all metrics, tokens, time, cost, and timestamp
4. WHEN no tests exist THEN I SHALL see an empty state encouraging me to run my first test
5. WHEN I clear history THEN the system SHALL remove all data from session storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my API keys and data to remain private, so that I can test sensitive instructions securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter my API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt it in session storage only
2. WHEN I close the browser THEN all data SHALL be automatically cleared
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL communicate directly with OpenRouter without server intermediation
4. WHEN using the application THEN no tracking cookies or analytics SHALL be present
5. WHEN I export results THEN the system SHALL generate files locally without server involvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export my test results and instructions, so that I can document and share my optimization work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a test THEN I SHALL see an "Export Results" button
2. WHEN I click export THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable file with test data
3. WHEN exporting THEN I SHALL be able to choose between JSON, CSV, or PDF formats
4. WHEN export completes THEN the file SHALL include instructions, prompts, results, and metrics
5. WHEN exporting session history THEN all tests SHALL be included in the export

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't block my testing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
2. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL see retry buttons to attempt the operation again
3. WHEN model search fails THEN the system SHALL show an error state with retry option
4. WHEN evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL preserve my inputs and allow retry
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to documentation and help, so that I can understand how the evaluation system works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application THEN I SHALL see "How does this work?" link in the header
2. WHEN I click the help link THEN I SHALL see a modal explaining the evaluation process
3. WHEN viewing help THEN I SHALL see information about metrics calculation and privacy
4. WHEN I need legal information THEN I SHALL find Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in the footer
5. WHEN reading documentation THEN the information SHALL be clear and comprehensive

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a responsive and accessible interface, so that I can use the tool on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN it SHALL work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN I navigate with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the interface SHALL provide appropriate labels and descriptions
4. WHEN viewing on small screens THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
5. WHEN interacting with forms THEN validation and feedback SHALL be clear and immediate

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and efficient performance, so that I can iterate quickly on my instruction optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL be ready for use within 2 seconds
2. WHEN searching models THEN results SHALL appear within 1 second of typing
3. WHEN running evaluations THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback
4. WHEN displaying results THEN animations SHALL be smooth and not block interaction
5. WHEN using session storage THEN operations SHALL not cause noticeable delays
